My PhD thesis is written in Chinese, however, one can find the essential 
results from my defense slides, which is written in English. The most 
interesting result is summarized at page 42, i.e., we found that the L-H 
transition has strong relation to micro-instability eigenstates jump. 

The linear evidences/results (main part of Chap 6) have been published
as a letter at PoP (Ref.[2]).

The nonlinear evidences/results and more results on simulations of HL-2A 
edge H-mode experiments are given in Chap 5 and 7. Considering that we 
are still further checking those results, the formal publish of them would
be delay. Thus, you can go though my thesis/slides beforehand in case you 
are interested in them.

The linear result can be cited as Ref.[2]. The nonlinear results can be 
cited as Ref.[1].

During the APS2015 meeting at Savarnnah, GA, USA, several colleagues told me more 
new envidences:

1. Frequency (usually TEMs) jump from low to high before and after L-H transition
have also been reported in EAST (G. S. Xu  et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 122502, 2012;
H. Q. Wang et al, Nucl. Fusion 52, 123011, 2012) and DIIID (K.K.Barada, APS2015) 
recently. 

2. Unconventional mode structures under strong gradient have also been found in
many other codes (e.g., GS2: http://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/research/alcator/pubs/APS/APS2005/ernst.pdf). 
We think our work is the first one to provide the general global picture of 
them and a general understanding to them and especailly tell the importants of them.
