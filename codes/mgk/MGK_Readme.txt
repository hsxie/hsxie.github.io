MGK (Multi-approach GyroKinetic code) code series are aimed to develop series gyrokinetic codes with different numerical schemes to check the validity of different numerical methods and to give conclusive physics results.

At the beginning stage, we focus on linear problem:
"
To help reveal the complete picture of linear kinetic drift modes, four independent numerical
approaches, based on integral equation, Euler initial value simulation, Euler matrix eigenvalue
solution and Lagrangian particle simulation, respectively, are used to solve the linear gyrokinetic
electrostatic drift modes equation in Z-pinch with slab simplification and in tokamak with ballooning
space coordinate.
